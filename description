Description: This contribution is a modelisation of random programs 
as measures in Coq. It has been designed for the 
AVERROES project (http://www-verimag.imag.fr/AVERROES/). 

It contains the following elements 
  - an axiomatisation of the interval [0,1] and derived properties
(files Ubase.v and Uprop.v);
  - a definition of measures on a type A as functions of type
(A->[0,1])->[0,1] enjoying special stability properties (files
Monads.v and Probas.v); proofs that these constructions have a
monadic structure;
  - an interpretation of programs of type A as measure, in particular
a fixpoint construction; the definition of an axiomatic semantic for
deriving judgements such as ``the probability of an expression e to
evaluate to a result satisfying property q is greater than p'' (file
Prog.v);
  - Proof of probabilistic termination of a linear random walk (file
Iterflip.v);
  - Proof of a program implementing a bernouilli distribution
(Proba(bernouilli()=true)=p) using a coin flip (file Bernouilli.v);
  - Proof of estimation of the combination of two random execution
(file Choice.v)
  - Definition of a measure on traces from a mesure on transitions
steps (file Nelist.v, Transitions.v) 

The document random.pdf contains a short introduction to the library
associated to the Gallina source code of the library.
